# Lipogram-game-Java-MySQL
This game tests the user's ability to determine which characters have been removed in a Lipogram. A Lipogram is a kind of constrained writing or word game consisting of strings in which a particular letter or group of letters is avoided. For example, 
- "Ths sentence s lackng ts ego" - "i" is missing.
- "Ths stce s lackng ts ego" - "i" and "en" are missing.
- "Thsstceslackngtsego" - "i", " " (space) and "en" are missing.

Rules:
- No punctuation is involved. I.e "don't" and "can't" are not used.
- No words are single-lettered.
- All words and lipograms are in lower case form.
- All words provided contained the lipogram in them.

Results:
- Number of words shown before correct Lipogram(s) determined.
- Number of characters shown before correct Lipogram(s) determined.
- The correct Lipogram(s). 
- Whether you were correct.

I implemented this game in Java and MySQL, where the a MySQL database stored the list of words to try. I also implemented this game using C#. Please visit here: [https://github.com/GregoryGreenfield/Lipogram-game-Java-MySQL
